I am Product Manager for B2B at [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.net), Europe's No. 1 flight search engine.

I also organise [ProductTank Edinburgh](http://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Edinburgh/), a monthly meetup for people interested in designing and building great web and mobile products.

I live in Edinburgh with my husband [Phil](http://twitter.com/philiproberts) and Hogs Boson the pygmy hedgehog.
