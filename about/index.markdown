![Hilary Roberts](http://www.startupsummit2012.com/images/speakers/hilary_roberts.png)

I am a Product Manager at [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.net), focusing on B2B products including the Skyscanner API.

I also organise ProductTank Edinburgh, a monthly meetup for people interested in designing and building great web and mobile products.

I live in Edinburgh with my husband [Phil](http://twitter.com/philiproberts) and Hogs Boson, our pygmy hedgehog.

You can find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/hilcsr).
