	<h2>Mentoring</h2>
		<p>Product can be a tough, lonely job—especially in smaller product teams or for product leaders. But it’s also one of the best roles you can have!</p>
		<p>I’ve benefitted tremendously from mentors in my own career. With the right support, you can develop faster, make better decisions and level up your strategic impact.</p>
