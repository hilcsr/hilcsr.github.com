		<h2>Product Leadership</h2>
		<p>2 x former CPO and ex-Director of Product. I’ve scaled global products, led through a turnaround culminating in a successful acquisition, and used product to repeatedly access new buyers and markets, improve monetisation, and deliver growth for start-ups and scale-ups.</p>
		<p>I’ve built collaborative, high-performing teams in in-person, remote and distributed team environments and place as much emphasis on developing talent as acquiring it. Peers would say that particular strengths I bring to a team are a knack for honing in on what's important, wholeheartedness and candor, and a focus on people that creates organisational "glue".</p>
		<p>Originally from Alaska and with stints in Washington, D.C. and Amsterdam, I currently live in Edinburgh and split my free time between the sea, the hills, and books.</p>
		<p>CV in brief:</p>	
		<ul>
			<li>CPO at <a href="http://www.wagestream.com">Wagestream</a>, London-based B2B2C fintech providing fairer financial services for all; global leader in Earned Wage Access. Currently Series B.</li>
			<li>CPO at <a href="http://www.bloomon.nl">bloomon</a>, Amsterdam-based high-end retail consumer subscription scale-up with a proprietary supply chain and tech platform. Acquired by <a href="http://www.bloomandwild.com">Bloom & Wild</a> in 2021.</li>
			<li>Director of Product at <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net">Skyscanner</a>, Edinburgh-based travel marketplace and global leader for flight metasearch. Acquired by <a href="http://www.ctrip.com">Ctrip</a> in 2016.</li>

	<h3>Mentoring</h3>
		<p>Product can be a tough, lonely job—especially in smaller product teams or for product leaders. But it’s also one of the best roles you can have!</p>
		<p>I’ve benefitted tremendously from mentors in my own career, so in my own time I also do 1-2-1 mentoring for product managers and leaders. With the right support, you can develop faster, make better decisions and level up your strategic impact.</p>
