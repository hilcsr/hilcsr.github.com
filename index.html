		<p>Some challenges faced by product leaders, startups and scaling companies are unique, but many are already well-solved.</p>
	
		<p>I help you and your team spend your energy on the things only you and your company need to solve, and quickly embed the best solutions for the rest.</p>

		</p>Think of it as being able to port briefly into the heads of dozens of other companies—and even into the future of your own company—to make better decisions now, right-sized for exactly your team and challenges.

		<p>If you’d like to discuss how I could help you or your team, get in touch. <a href="http://www.calendly.com/hilaryroberts">Book a 30 mins no obligation virtual coffee.</a></p>

		<h3>For individuals:</h3>
		<p>I’ve benefitted tremendously from mentors in my own career, so in my own time I also do 1-2-1 mentoring for product managers and leaders. Product can be a tough, lonely job—especially in smaller product teams or for product leaders. But it’s also one of the best roles you can have!</p>
		<p>Happy to hear from you if I can help. For mentoring, it’s extremely helpful if you can use the form below to provide a few details in advance:</p>

		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I’m an executor and product person. With more than 10 years in tech and product, I’ve spent the past four years in product leadership:
			<ul>
				<li>CPO at Wagestream, London-based B2B2C fintech providing fairer financial services for all; global leader in Earned Wage Access. Currently Series B.</li>
				<li>CPO at bloomon, Amsterdam-based high-end retail consumer subscription scale-up with a proprietary supply chain and tech platform. Acquired by Bloom&Wild in 2021.</li>
				<li>Director of Product at Skyscanner, Edinburgh-based travel marketplace and global leader for flight metasearch. Acquired by Ctrip in 2016.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	<p>The common threads were:
		<ul>
			<li>Delivering top-line business impact</li>
			<li>Scaling global products internationally</li>
			<li>Re-igniting growth in scaling companies (avoiding plateaus!)</li>
			<li>Building best-in-class product organisations and high-performing teams</li>
			<li>Attracting and developing top talent</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p>Originally from Alaska and with stints in Washington, D.C. and Amsterdam, I currently live in Edinburgh and split my free time between the sea, the mountains and books.</p>


<!-- 	<p>Today, I still focus on the big problems over the small ones and on long-term success over short-term gain. I'm also a <a href="https://vimeo.com/189598824">keen&nbsp;experimenter</a>, continually running tests on everything from my morning routine, to the way I develop talent, to my understanding of my users' mental models. Call it survival instinct.</p> 

	<p>For the past five years I have been applying these principles to build simple, high-growth global consumer products at <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net">Skyscanner</a>. With more than 60 million monthly users and 70M app downloads, Skyscanner is one of the world's largest marketplaces for travel. I am currently a Director of Product.
