Well [Ewan McIntosh](http://edu.blogs.com), I hope you are happy. This is at least the third blog (the other 2 I know of being [Hilary's](http://www.hilarysinger.com) & [Roderick's](http://roderickhodgson.com) you have started after your recent berating of all the blog-less attendees of BarCamp Scotland 2009.

As well as being a response to Ewan&rsquo;s bullying, this blog was started for two reasons:

* A place to muse on my experiences in electronics, web development, design, usability and so forth.
* To beat Hilary's blog, _So It Goes_, to a race to the top of a google search for our respective names.

Sadly, it's going to take something of a miracle to win that race, given that Hilary Singer is apparently a [very uncommon name](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hilary+singer "Google Search").

Oh well, I'll just have to focus on content then.
