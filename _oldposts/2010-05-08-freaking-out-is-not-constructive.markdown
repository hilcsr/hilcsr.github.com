title: Freaking Out is Not Constructive
---

A lot of Lib-Dem voters seem to be freaking out about the fact that Nick Clegg is in talks with the Conservatives. I am certainly no political analyst, but I think a lot of people could do with taking a step back and chilling-out a bit. Here are my thoughts

- Like it or not the Conservatives received more votes, and more seats, than any other party in this election. 

- Nick Clegg and the rest going behind the Cons' backs to create a coalition government hardly smacks of fairness, and puts the LibDems at risk of backlash from an expanded Conservative base many of which are clearly ex-Labour voters who are fed up with the current Labour government.

- By courting the Conservatives, the LibDems can make the demands they would see fit for forming a coalition. Hopefully these include significant compromise from the Cons on Immigration, defence, and most importantly electoral reform.

- If the Conservatives cave on their demands (which seems unlikely to me), then we have a significantly diluted Con-Lib government. Yes it might not be exactly what you voted for, but get over it. A LibDem majority was a (very long) shot, and it's much better than a Conservative only government. Also with electoral reform in place, we are in a much better position for the next election.

- If the Conservatives don't give in (which seems much more likely), then Nick Clegg will be free to say "sorry, we tried, the Cons are being unreasonable", and go to Labour and the rest and try to form a majority government.

Clearly Nick Clegg could cave on all the important issues, and form a coalition anyway. If that happens then by all means start a riot. Otherwise, just chill out: the LibDems haven't betrayed you yet. Instead of fuming at them, why not send them a reminder of which issues are most important to you for forming a coalition: http://38degrees.org.uk/lib-dems.
