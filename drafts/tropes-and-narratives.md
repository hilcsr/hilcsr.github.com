Tropes are an essential part of storytelling. A trope is something of a framework storyline that is commonly used to structure a story. A trope may apply to the whole plot, a character, character trait or an individual scene.

An author uses tropes as a starting point for story and character development. Some classic tropes might be:

* _The damsel in distress_: There is a damsel, she has been captured by some evil character, and the hero must rescue her to save the day (this is an often overused trope in video games in particular).
* _The superhero_: A seemingly normal human character has been bestowed superhuman powers, and must save mankind from some evil force, who often has their own superpowers. Mankind is initially distrustful of the superhero, but comes to appreciate them once they save the day.
* _The superhero fight scene at the end of the movie_: our superhero movie always ends with a final battle between good and evil. The fight goes back and forth, with it looking like a close call, but good wins in the end (see _happy ending trope_).
* _The kiss between superhero and love interest at the end of the superhero movie after the fight_: tropes can cover just a single encounter.

While they may sound formulaic, tropes are very useful literary devices. They help the viewer/reader settle in to a story. The viewer can feel comfortable with the story as they understand the basic storyline already - we al know roughly how a rom-com plays out. This allows the reader to focus on the events elements and characters which make _this_ story uniue.

A writer can also twist tropes - making an unexpected departure from the typical storyline to catch the reader off guard, or may avoid tropes altogether, particularly powerful for the main storyline. Consider a movie like Memento, where a character with short term memory loss must figure out what he's doing, and the movie is played to us effectively backwards. This is not a classic, or formulaic trope - but it does make it harder work for the reader to follow.

Tropes and narratives are undoubtedly as old as stories themselves, and for storytelling they seem very effective and useful.

I have been thinking a lot though, about narratives and tropes in "real life" and whether they are useful, or harmful.

Each of us is undoubtedly unique - but it seems we can see tropes around us every day.

* The strict fathe
* The know it all
* The high school drop out
* The layabout.

These are tropes from real-life that we all understand, and have either experienced, seen, or are at least aware of. Like in storytelling, these tropes can be helpful. We can infer how the quiet loner that we see at the office is likely to act at home, socialising, at the pub. We can surmise that a harsh father is perhaps not the best husband, or the kindest of souls.

But there are a lot of downsides to labelling people, and seeing these tropes everywhere. They don't allow for nuance - we assume the lazy layabout will be late with everything - even though they may just really enjoy taking it easy at the weekend and are otherwise well put together and punctual.

The trope in reality also doesn't account for our uniqueness. The power of a trope in storytelling as it allows the writer to more easily convey the uniqueness of the story and the characters.  But I'm not so sure tropes for the real world do the same. Life is mesy, we make snap judgements of people and situations. There is no master storyteller weaving a well put together over the course of 2 hours or 500 pages - with the time and space to convery that nuance. We spot laziness, we azzume lazy in about 30 seconds.

Breaking free from tropes is hard. During university I frequently broke things: I am tall with long clumsy limbs, and I am not particularly mindful. This became known as my "range of damage" - anything in that range was at danger from my flailing.

At first it was an ammusing narrative, I suppose. Whenever anything broke in a 10 foot radius of me it was attributed to my "range of damage" even if it was in no way my fault.

Once a narrative is in place, we can't help but fit things into that narrative. People love patterns, we can create them from randomness, so we _want_ to fit things into a narrative. That mug broke when Phil picked it up - well it makes _more_ sense that it's was Phil's fault as it fits his "range of damage" narrative pretty well.

Eight years later, I have grown up, I have more control of my limbs, but the narrative stands. I still hear that phrase from time to time when things go awry (or nearly do), and perhaps  will never escape it.
