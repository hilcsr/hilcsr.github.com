caption: "We recently had a Rubik's Cube themed party for everyone who has been helping out at [TechCube](http&#58;//techcube-ed.tumblr.com/).

Since I was on playlist duty, I figured we needed some appropriate visuals and whipped up a little visualizer that responds to the music in Processing. Particularly cool was that since it was projected onto the ceiling it could be seen from the street below.

Blog post coming soon."
