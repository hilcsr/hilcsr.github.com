title: Founder depression, and a meetup proposal.
categories: [essay]

As both a [capital-F founder](http://blog.latentflip.com/post/19403885675/generalists-founders-imposters) and developer, the last 12 months have been tough. I have personally been stuck in some pretty deep lows, and of the assumption that I was the only one struggling with a lot of questions about who I am, what I am doing, and whether I'm good enough to do it.

The last couple of months have been a lot better, triggered by a few things:

* **Going to the doctor:** who said lots of nice things like "what you are doing sounds really hard", "the most common thing I see in this room is depression", "yes it looks like you have mild depression", "here's some practical things you can do that aren't drugs".
* **Speaking to an (off-duty) counsellor:** possibly the most "productive" hour I have spent in a long time.
* **Writing that [blog post](http://blog.latentflip.com/post/19403885675/generalists-founders-imposters)**

But the most powerful thing has been opening up to a number of different founders and developers about what I've been going through, and them replying with "**wait, I say those things all the time too - I thought I was the only one**". The following relief of finding someone else going through the same stuff has been palpable for both of us.

### A proposal

As a result of this, I am thinking of starting a meetup/support-group in Edinburgh to help founders, developers, and anyone building products share some of their _personal_ experiences with this stuff and learn from each other.

I haven't got it all figured out yet - so I'm looking for feedback, but here's some rough thoughts:

* **Non-technical/business**: we have plenty of technical meetups, this is a place to reflect on our _selves_ rather than code/biz. Clearly a lot of our emotions are affected by the work we are doing - but the focus is definitely on the personal stuff.
* **Open to anyone related to running businesses/building stuff** (not just founders)
* **Confidential:** at the meetup: share, otherwise: shush. :)
* **Supportive, not dismissive**: I think this goes without saying. None of this: "oh, sure, that's easy, you can just fix yourself by â€¦ eating more! My problem is much more serious!"
* **Small**: I'm not sure how we would manage this if the group became a run away success, but I think at least initially it would be good to try and keep the groups small as sharing this stuff is hard enough as it is.
* **Format**: As a first meeting, I am thinking I would talk about some of the stuff I've been going through, and see if we can use that to kick-start a bit of a group discussion and take it from there.
* **When/where?:** I'd like to have a first meeting soonish, but I haven't got a venue - so if anyone has any thoughts for somewhere that's free, I'd love to hear them.
