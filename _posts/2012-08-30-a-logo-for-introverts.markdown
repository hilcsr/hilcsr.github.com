I love the idea of a logo for us introverts. I'm not sure why, perhaps as a way of legitimising us.

Here are some ideas. My favourite variation so far is:

which grew from:

### The hamster ball

### Dashed hamster ball

### The fish bowl

I'm leaning towards the dashed line, as it makes it clear it's a guideline, rather than hard and fast rule, for an introvert's personal space.

The concept of the hamster ball, and later fish bowl, came from: [How to live with introverts](http://blog.latentflip.com/post/30513286517/how-to-live-with-introverts), but I prefer the simpler, version as it's not very obvious what the other shapes are.

What do you think? Any other ideas?
